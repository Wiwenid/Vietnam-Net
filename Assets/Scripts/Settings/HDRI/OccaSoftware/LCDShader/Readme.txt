About
--------------------------------
LCD Object Shader enables you to improve the quality of televisions, computer monitors, and other small- and large-scale displays in your game.

This shader enables you to display subpixel detail in your screens. It also enables you to display scanlines, micro display noise, and to emulate viewing angle distortions characteristic of modern and recent display panels such as brightness loss, chroma loss, and hue shifting.

Comes with 5 diode arrangements, 12 diode styles, and 4 scanline styles in both stylized and realistic versions, some modeled on real displays.

This shader includes a custom editor so that you can easily customize each material instance.

This Shader was developed entirely using Shader Graph. As a result, it is easy to customize and extend for your project's needs. It also includes complete source code, including editor scripts. You can customize the editor script or simply remove the editor script reference from the Shader Graph if you'd prefer not to use it.


Installation Instructions
--------------------------------
1. Import LCD Object Shader into your project.
2. Explore the demo scene for usage references.
3. Drag and drop a material using the LcdObjectShader onto any screen objects.


Usage Instructions
--------------------------------
1. Customize the Material using the LcdObjectShader, then drag and drop onto any object you would like to emulate a screen.
2. If you'd like to use a video as input for the screen emulation, reference the VideoDemo prefab included in the demo. If unavailable, simply add a videoplayer clip to the object that is using the material and set the Render Mode to Material Override and the material property to _MainTex.
3. If you'd like to use a Render Texture, simply drag the Render Texture asset onto the Material's Screen Texture input slot.
